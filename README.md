# Elgentos SNOWWWW

Add snowflakes to your Magento site!

Just change the class or id to the element you want it to snow:

``` 
skin/frontend/base/default/css/elgentos_snow/snow.css 
```

Warning, this extension adds 3 images.
Feel free to rewrite to css snow flakes :)

Because a demo says more than 1000 words:

This extension is also ready for the year 2017
